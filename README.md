# Responsive UIs in Flutter / Creating Fluid User Interfaces

Flutter is a portable language: it can render on Mobile, Desktop, Web - even embedded. But portability goes beyond its cross-platform capabilities. You should strive to make your apps adjust to the multiple screens in which your users will consume your app. In this workshop you'll learn how to take advantage of the responsive capabilities available in Flutter and make your Flutter apps adapt to the screens in which they render, and create fluid, responsive experience that will delight your users, regardless of the platform, screen size, orientation, etc.

## What is Responsive Design?

Responsive Design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation, in the hopes of achieving a fluid user interface that satisfies the needs of users and delivers a seamless experience.

In this Dartpad Workshop and just a few steps I'll walk you through interactive examples on how to accomplish this in your apps with minimal effort:

 
- Implementing Media Queries: using the MediaQuery widget to query your screen dimensions
- Change the layout of your interface based on widget constraints using LayoutBuilder
- Learn the basic widgets that allow for responsiveness out of the box (Expanded, Flexible)
- Other responsive-aware widgets to know about (AspectRatio, OrientationBuilder)
